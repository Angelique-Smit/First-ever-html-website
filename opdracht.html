                    <h3 class="h3"> Sprint 1</h3>
                        <p class="p"> In CLE1, we had to build a robot to help someone with a problem they experience in their daily life.
                            For sprint 1 I started by interviewing my classmate Sam. He had already completed a college course
                            in design and wanted to improve his drawing skills, both analog and digital. With this information
                            I decided to build a drawing robot. It drives around with a colored pencil tip that leaves a line.
                            After setting these lines, the user of the robot can draw inspiration from the artwork that the robot
                            made and start drawing.
                        </p>

                        <p class="p">
                            First, sketches were made to give shape to the robot I ideated. From these sketches came the idea to use a pencil
                            running the "body" of the bot with a servo in it that changes between 2 colors. After making the sketches,
                            I started thinking of what material to use for the robot. An icecream box was the best box I had for this, since it is large yet
                            was light enough. The way the lid opens allow easy access inside the body of the robot in order to access the cricket.
                            The bot moves around on 2 motors with wheels attached to it and drives on top of the paper.
                        </p>

                        <p class="p">
                            The robot can move forward by receiving infrared signals or by pressing button A on the cricket.
                            Furthermore, the robot can drive backwards and turn. There is also a small easter egg in the robot. The speed of the robot
                            is determined by Math.RandomRange and when the motor speed value is above 50% or below 10%,
                            a melody is played. There are also lights to indicate how long 1 of the 2 colored pencil points
                            will be on the paper.
                        </p>

                <h3 class="h3"> Sprint 3</h3>
                    <p class="p"> 
                        For the second and third sprint for this project I have been working on a locker/safe called "Docker."
                        My peerteam decided we wanted to fully develop Sam's, my peermate, his prototype from sprint 1. We decided to
                        link our locker to Scrooge mcDuck since he is the most iconic cartoon and one of the most time-less characters
                        that have ties to lockers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="p">
                        During sprint 2 I developed hinges for the Locker along with a lock system using 3D print technologies. I designed
                        these in Tinkercad, an online 3D design tool. I also assembeled the Locker itself during sprint 2. During the final
                        sprint I improved the door, made some smaller quality of life changes to the locker and got the lock mechanism fully working.

                <h2 class="h2"> Character concepts for a videogame</h2>
                <h3 class="h3"> Jake </h3>
                    <p class="p"> This is one of the designs I made for a game. Since the game was made for a school assignment
                        and not as a project, I was very limited in what I could. I was only allowed to make uncolored character concepts.
                        I designed two player characters. I chose to make a boy and a girl playable character for diversity
                        reasons. Although I was not allowed to color the sketches, I did suggest what colors would suit the characters and these 
                        reccomendations have been adopted in the final design.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p">
                        The boy has blond hair, pale skin and a green suit with yellow patches on it. He also wears a blindfold because the character is
                        is blind. The boy character was named "Jake." This was done because the game maker's name was also Jake and
                        his favorite color is green. The hair was made blond because the game maker didn't want a full self-insert character
                        since he found this to be quite cringe.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p">
                        This character uses ninja stars as a weapon. I opted for ninja stars because, in addition to a visual difference between the weapons 
                        of both characters, the maker also wanted to make a difference in mechanics, in order to increase replayability. Jake throws the ninja 
                        stars quickly and deals a few hit points per star. In total, Jake has 10 throwing stars. The throwing stars are reloaded when
                        the R button is pressed. I opted for ninja stars, because I wanted to make a high spam-low damage weapon and a
                        low spam - high damage weapon. The range had to be relatively the same, which restricted me
                        to longer-range weapons. Ninja stars are a big staple in the game community and thus doesn't need to have a long explanation
                        needed, making it a good choice for a weapon in a small platformer with enemies.

                <h3> Jasmine </h3>
                <p class="p">
                    Jasmine is female playable character I designed. She is also the first character I made for the game and
                    the most basic character in terms of design, in my opinion. She has no unique character traits that are almost non-existent in other games.
                    Because of this I label her the  as the most "boring" concept I made for this game. However, I'm still happy with her design, since too much unique
                    character traits quickly starts to feel "too much" and can feel like you are trying to design the "main character" in a world of side characters.
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    Jasmine has a darker skintone; dark brown wavy hair; a red jacket and an orange top. I chose to make Jasmine a POC, since there was a lot of discussion 
                    about minorities being under-represented in the media nowadays, including games. It personally felt right combat this ongoing issue in today's media, 
                    even if this media is only for a school project. The bright colors of Jasmine's clothes matched her skin complexion well, so they were quickly chosen.
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    Jasmine uses a boomerang as a weapon. This is a kind weapon that people quickly grasp the concept of, since most western people know what a boomerang is.
                    Boomerangs also roughly have the same range as throwing stars. This made it the best weapon to implement. Her boomerang does considerably more damage
                    than Jake's throwing stars, but also has a significantly higher cooldown, as the boomerang can only be used again
                    when it is back in the player's hand. This also makes higher precision pay off more, rewarding you on your mechanical skills.
                    This makes her kit interesting for gamers with more experience, despite her lacking design.
