                    <ul id="#lijstHobbies">
                        <li> <p class="p">My name is Angelique Smit and I am a videogame enthousiast. My very first console was a Nintendo DS that 
                            I got for one of my birthdays as a kid. It was my first real experience with playing videogames and I loved it.
                            My parents were always very much against pirating games, so they bought me single games as a kid, which made me get
                            a considerable amount of DS games, about 30, as the years went on. Because of this I have quite the collection of games,
                            ranging from triple A titles such as Mario 64 to Dora the explorer, in my collection. After I got my ds my parents
                            gifted me Wii back in 2009 when those consoles were as popular as the nintendo switch is nowadays. This obviously 
                            made my physical game collection grow as well. Around 2013 I started using my main console, the PC. I mainly play shooters
                            like Overwatch, Apex Legends or CS:GO but games like HollowKnight, Pokmon, Harvestmoon and Maplestory 2 are very high on my
                            favorite game list as well. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="p">For the last 3 years I have mainly been playing Overwatch and I have
                            even played for an amateur e-sports team. Although I technically didnt win in any competition with my team, I did end up
                            high in the rankings in the tournaments we played in. I also created and managed a team myself, which came third in a well known
                            tournament (GGEU) in their respective skill bracket.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p class="p">I am quite a creative person. I oftend draw traditionally, on paper,
                                instead of digital. Last year, I made character art for a friend of mine who was making a
                                small game for a school project. Besides this I made a surreal portrait made of a famous 
                                artist back in highschool. This painting, as far as I know, still hangs in one of the math classrooms
                                in that highschool.

                            <p class="p">On weekends and holidays, cooking dinner is often left to me. This made me realise how fun
                                cooking can be. When I have the time and feel like it, I grab a cookbook and try a dish from it
                                to cook. I also like to bake and have been doing this since I was 12. Since I live in a small family
                                I only bake when there is an opportunity to hand out my baking to other people, so that it
                                the thing I bake do not have to be thrown away.

                <li>
                    <p class="p"> I want to gain enough knowledge to create websites that stand out and are on par with business websites out there
                    as I am considering to become a webdeveloper.After my studies I plan to live and work abroad, which makes website 
                    design a good field to work in, since it can be done anywhere as long as you have an internet connection.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p class="p">
                    Web development is something that is needed everywhere these days and can be done without having to use an informal language
                    besides english. This makes me very motivated to make this website look the way I like using the knowledge I gain from the classes. 
                    I hope to learn as much as possible during this course to broaden my knowledge in order to have a bigger chance of getting a job later
                    in life.
